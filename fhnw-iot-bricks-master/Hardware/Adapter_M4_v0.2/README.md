### OpenScad
* Install OpenScad from https://openscad.org/
* Design a board outline according to the noted size (in mm)
* Render the design to enable exporting it
* Export the 2D design as SVG
* Edit the SVG file manually (based on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydcOzbCJltg
))
    * Enclose the `<path .../>` section(s) in a `<g>...</g>`
    * Set the `id` to `board`
    * Set the `stroke` to `none`
    * Set the `stroke-width` to `0`
* Copy the whole `<g>...</g>` element
    * Set the copy's `id` to `silkscreen`
    * Set its `stroke` to `black`
    * Set its `fill` to `none`
    * Set its `stroke-width` to `0.203`
* The result should look like this<pre>
	&lt;svg&gt;...
        &lt;g id="board"&gt;&lt;path d="..." stroke="none" fill="lightgray" stroke-width="0"/>&lt;/g&gt;
        &lt;g id="silkscreen">&lt;path d="..." stroke="black" fill="none" stroke-width="0.203"/&gt;&lt;/g&gt;
